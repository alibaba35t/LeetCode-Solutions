# LeetCode-Solutions
This is my algorithm repository, which includes my training solutions and problem-solving practice.
Hey, I am Alibaba35t. I have started sharing my projects and training solutions on GitHub. 
I admit that my code may not always be the most optimal for a given problem. 
If you find a project that interests you and have a more efficient solution, I would love for you to share it with me. 
Let's discuss and exchange perspectives!
